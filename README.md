# **INFORMAL ENGLISH QUIZ - 2nd milestone project**

## **Introduction**

</br>

This is my second milestone project in which I added Java Script to make the website interactive.  I created an Informal English quiz based on a lesson I used to teach as an EFL teacher. The phrases I included in the quiz were very confusing for me when I first arrived in the UK. I did not understand them even though I could speak very good English (at least that's what I thought back then). I hope the use of authentic, real English will make this quiz fun and useful for students of English who want to sound more like native speakers and improve their understanding of informal expressions.

## **Strategy Plane**

</br>

**The business goals for the website:**

1. To check students knowledge of some common informal expressions in English.
2. To help students of English learn these expressions by providing an option of retaking the quiz as many times as they want.
3. To promote knowledge of informal English, as it's rarely taught in language schools.
4. To make the quiz fun and enjoyable so that it attracts students to take it more than once.

**User stories:**

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the quiz.
