# **INFORMAL ENGLISH QUIZ - 2nd milestone project**

## **Introduction**

</br>

This is my second milestone project in which I added Java Script to make the website interactive.  I created an Informal English quiz based on a lesson I used to teach as an EFL teacher. The phrases I included in the quiz were very confusing for me when I first arrived in the UK. I did not understand them even though I could speak very good English (at least that's what I thought back then). I hope the use of authentic, real English will make this quiz fun and useful for students of English who want to sound more like native speakers and improve their understanding of informal expressions.
